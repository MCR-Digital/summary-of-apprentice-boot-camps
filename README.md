# Manchester Digital Boot Camp List

Boot camps are delivered roughly monthly as part of the Manchester Digital Level 4 Software Developer apprenticeship. They provide targetted ‘off-the-job’ learning for apprentices to supplement the experience they get ‘on-the-job’ at their employer.

The boot camps are delivered by facilitators from various employer companies. The aim is that the supporting material is stored in this GitHub organisation, to facilitate collaboration and future accessibility.

## Available Boot Camps
This page has a list of the boot camps in the order they are currently delivered.

## Creating boot camp resources

There is an [apprentice-boot-camp-template](https://github.com/MCR-Digital/apprentice-boot-camp-template) which acts as a starting point for any new boot camp material. It includes a starting point for creating slides using Markdown (Slides As Code) which are converted to reveal.js HTML slides. We prefer this approach as it is easier for people to collaborate with pull requests, and working together without having to negotiate how to share Powerpoint files. We also get the benefits of version control which makes us feel that our content is safer.

## Mentoring boot camps

Since our apprentices work in a variety of languages and in a variety of organisations, it’s both necessary and really beneficial for them to have input from people in different backgrounds. Most of our boot camps involve coding exercises. The people facilitating the boot camp are rarely equipped to provide expert advice to the apprentices about each of these languages. So we try to have experts in each language available to support the apprentices while they carry out these exercises. Mentoring is a fantastic opportunity to practice skills which you might not be able to exercise back in the office.

As a mentor you can expect to assist with both days (ideally) of a boot camp. You may be involved in a one hour planning call a few weeks before the boot camp, while the preparations are still being made. You should also be involved in a boot camp run through, where you will find out more about the practical exercises that you will be supporting. This is useful so that they aren’t new to you on the day of the boot camp.

You’ll join the boot camp around 9am (slightly earlier than the apprentices) so that any last minute discussions can happen, and so that everyone is present when the apprentices join. The boot camp will likely have sections of presentation. You may be familiar with the content already. Feel free to do some admin / other tasks during these periods, but be ready for the exercises which should happen frequently. You’ll be supporting a specific group of apprentices, and they may have questions for you about how to approach a task or how to fix something that is blocking them. They will really benefit from the conversations they have with you, especially if you share your own point of view and listen to understand what it is they need from you.

While you don’t need to be super experienced, it is helpful if mentors have experience of supporting other inexperienced people. Ideally you’ll be familiar with coaching someone towards finding the answer themselves, rather than giving them the solution. The exercises are intended to reinforce the learning, and give them an opportunity to do some coding outside their usual environment. For remote boot camps, we try to have a mentor available for every two apprentices, and you’ll work on the exercises in a dedicated breakout room. For physical boot camps we are able to move around the room more easily and mentors can cover up to four apprentices each.

While the apprentices are working on exercises please be present to receive questions. When co-located, mingle with the group and find ways to invite yourself in by asking open questions like ‘how are you getting on?’ and ‘where are you up to?’ rather than closed questions like ‘do you need any help?’ (to which the answer will almost always be ‘no’). We regularly get feedback that apprentices have got loads out of a conversation with a mentor. A one-to-one conversation can be incredibly valuable.

At the end of each day, mentors will hang back for a quick debrief to discuss how the day has gone with the facilitators. This can be critical to shape the delivery of the next day, and often the next year. If you have useful feedback about the apprentices then note it down (with their name) as it can be useful for organisations to hear how their apprentices have negotiated the boot camp.
