# Manchester Digital Boot Camp List

Boot camps are delivered roughly monthly as part of the Manchester Digital Level 4 Software Developer apprenticeship. They provide targetted ‘off-the-job’ learning for apprentices to supplement the experience they get ‘on-the-job’ at their employer.

The boot camps are delivered by facilitators from various employer companies. The aim is that the supporting material is stored in this GitHub organisation, to facilitate collaboration and future accessibility.

## Available Boot Camps
This page has a list of the boot camps in the order they are currently delivered.

## Creating boot camp resources

There is an [apprentice-boot-camp-template](https://github.com/MCR-Digital/apprentice-boot-camp-template) which acts as a starting point for any new boot camp material. It includes a starting point for creating slides using Markdown (Slides As Code) which are converted to reveal.js HTML slides. We prefer this approach as it is easier for people to collaborate with pull requests, and working together without having to negotiate how to share Powerpoint files. We also get the benefits of version control which makes us feel that our content is safer.
