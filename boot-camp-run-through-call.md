# Boot Camp Run Through Call

A few days before the boot camp the facilitators will take the mentors through the structure of the boot camp, to make sure they are equipped to provide support.

Here is a suggested structure for the call:

- Introductions
- Thank people for mentoring and explain importance
- What people want to know about the boot camp
- What the breakdown of the cohort is
- What being a mentor is (check people know about the description in this repo)
  - Encourage open questions and coaching towards their own solutions
  - Encourage them to share their own perspectives, including during talking segments
- What the purpose of the boot camp is (high level)
  - Step through the exercises, highlighting any important bits
- Explain what to expect ‘on the day’
  - What the expectations are around their involvement
- Joining instructions
  - Remote/physical
  - Time
  - Location
  - Arriving before apprentices
  - Debrief at the end of each day
